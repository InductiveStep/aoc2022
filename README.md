Solutions:
 
[Day 1: Calorie Counting](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc01.nb.html)

[Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc02.nb.html)

[Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc03.nb.html)

[Day 4: Camp Cleanup](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc04.nb.html)

[Day 5: Supply Stacks](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc05.nb.html)

[Day 6: Tuning Trouble](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc06.nb.html)

[Day 7: No Space Left On Device](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc07.nb.html)

[Day 8: Treetop Tree House](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc08.nb.html)

[Day 9: Rope Bridge](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc09.nb.html)

[Day 10: Cathode-Ray Tube](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc10.nb.html)

Here onwards required thinking, so I'm being a bit more selective...

[Day 11: Monkey in the Middle](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc11.nb.html). For part 2, I relied on an explanation [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zihouc/comment/izrimjo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to find the right modulus to stop the numbers exploding.

[Day 12: Hill Climbing Algorithm](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc12.nb.html). This is my favourite. I used it to learn how to use the {igraph} package.

[Day 13: Distress Signal](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc13.nb.html), with thanks to [@jrh-dev](https://github.com/jrh-dev) for the [working logic](https://github.com/jrh-dev/Advent-of-Code-2022/blob/main/R/d13.r) (mine only worked on the test input). Part 2 was then easy.

[Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc15.nb.html): Part 1 surprisingly worked using a brute-force solution - after 4 hours :) Following an ultimately fruitless detour into integer programming, {sf} rescued Part 2. Another package I hadn't used before. Drawing a picture helped get to {sf}.

[Day 18: Boiling Boulders](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc18.nb.html): Part 1 was easy. Part 2 was not until I realised I could use {igraph} again, this time on an undirected graph.
