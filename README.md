[Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc02.nb.html)

[Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc03.nb.html)

[Day 5: Supply Stacks](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc05.nb.html)

[Day 6: Tuning Trouble](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc06.nb.html)

[Day 7: No Space Left On Device](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc07.nb.html)

[Day 9: Rope Bridge](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc09.nb.html)

[Day 10: Cathode-Ray Tube](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc10.nb.html)

[Day 11: Monkey in the Middle](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc11.nb.html). For part 2, I relied on an explanation [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zihouc/comment/izrimjo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to find the right modulus to stop the numbers exploding.

[Day 12: Hill Climbing Algorithm](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc12.nb.html). This is my favourite. I used it to learn how to use the {igraph} package.

[Day 13: Distress Signal](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc13.nb.html), with thanks to [@jrh-dev](https://github.com/jrh-dev) for the [working logic](https://github.com/jrh-dev/Advent-of-Code-2022/blob/main/R/d13.r) (mine only worked on the test input). Part 2 was then easy.

[Day 15: Beacon Exclusion Zone](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2022/aoc15.nb.html): Part 1 surprisingly worked using a brute-force solution - after 4 hours :) Part 2 TBC.
